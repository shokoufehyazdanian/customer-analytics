# Customer Analytics Platform

End-to-End Data Analytics & Machine Learning Platform

This project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics platform
built with modern data engineering, analytics and machine learning tools.

The goal is to analyze customer behavior, generate business insights,
and predict customer churn.
## Business Problem

E-commerce companies need to understand:

- Which customers generate the most value?
- Which products drive revenue?
- Which customers are at risk of churn?
- How can data support business decisions?

This project builds a complete analytics pipeline
to answer these questions.
